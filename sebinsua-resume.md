### Summary

I learnt to program at the age of sixteen after discovering a
flourishing homebrew community. Realising that self-taught amateurs
could create products was inspiring to me. I’m still amazed by the
work done by small empowered teams.

Over the years I've worked with many languages within many different
environments. Nowadays I do a lot of commercial work in JavaScript
due to its prevalence but in my spare time I like Rust due to
its mixture of low-level and functional programming.

My engineering practices are influenced by: [the
twelve-factor app](http://12factor.net), a [conservative attitude
towards microservices](https://www.tigerteam.dk/2014/micro-services-its-not-only-the-size-that-matters-its-also-how-you-use-them-part-2/), unit testing & TDD, a light sprinkle of functional
programming, the [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/),
and [Simple Made Easy](http://infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).

I specialise in combining technical knowledge with lateral thinking.
I particularly like to advise on systems that maximise a businesses
_technical leverage_ while also reducing their exposure to _execution costs_.

Knowing when not to solve a problem is as important as knowing how to solve it.

**Technical specialties:** Full-stack software design and
implementation. I follow the mantra _the right tool for the right job_ and
try to keep solutions as simple and common as possible.

**Other:** I've run small standups in the past; I enjoy learning about:
product design, UX, and market analysis; I ran a Hackathon once.

### Experience

##### **[~](http://www.momentumlabs.io)** _London, United Kingdom / Remote_

###### **Freelancer** _Jun '13 – Present_

_Freelancing, consulting and open-source activities._

- [Banking for your command line.](https://github.com/sebinsua/teller-cli) Written in Rust.
- [Access Twitter data without an API key.](https://github.com/sebinsua/scrape-twitter)
- [Graphviz templates as visual configuration of Neo4j database insertions.](https://github.com/sebinsua/graphviz-config-template)

##### **[Shell](https://www.shell.com)** _London_

###### **Technical Lead** _Dec '18 – Jun '19_

_Shell is one of the six oil and gas "supermajors" and the fifth-largest company in the world._

Laid the foundations of a scalable Data Science/Engineering practice.

- Starting from zero, hired multiple Data Engineers and Data Scientists into the team (eventually ~10 DE/DS). Established a streamlined hiring process for the future.
- Reviewed earlier work on the project by a consultancy, and created a plan on how to improve problem areas. Communicated the path forwards to both non-technical stakeholders and globally distributed technical team members. Centred power within a core DE/DS team that would oversee future quality, and setup weekly discussions for thoughtful collaboration and daily stand-ups to stay in sync.
- Established a continuous integration process to allow robust improvement of the data engineering and models. This was used to test and document the original code so that it would be understood by future team members.
- Prioritised the rapid build of a scalable data platform to enable the new development workflow. This caused the data pipeline to run end-to-end ~4x faster, and meant that data engineers could spend more time programming and less time waiting for pipelines to finish.
- Helped the team to share their knowledge of modern software engineering practices. Together we created and taught training workshops to teach Data Scientists modern practices for collaborating towards high-quality models (Git, PRs, CI, etc). Outside of the workshops, we used shared repositories to document the onboarding process, how to use Git for collaboration, best practices in EDAs, etc.

Tools: Azure, CircleCI, Docker, Email, Helm, Jupyter, Kubernetes, Python, Spark Cluster, Slack.

- Improved modularity of software by demonstrating how to use Rollup and Babel 7 to create best-in-class packages that support CommonJS, ES modules and types.
- Improved encapsulation of development work by making an authenticated and declarative API for the loading and code-splitting of sub-applications.
- Helped to educate others on best practices with working code showing higher-order components, render props, reducer components, performance implications, hooks, etc.
- Evangelised a modern development process leading to multiple teams across the company moving to Lerna monorepos.

- Created a series of single-page dashboard apps. Conversations with internal customers helped me to come up with ideas on how to simplify business processes. For example a way of signing off groups of driver’s profile changes was given a UX that defaulted to approval but forced the user to sign a receipt of the changes: this helps with speed while also ensuring accountability.
- Other components were created so that behaviour relating to presentation was well-separated from configuration and data input; or made so that they could be updated in real-time, for example: an animated map of driver locations.
