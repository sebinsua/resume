### Summary

I learnt to program when I was sixteen after discovering a small but
flourishing homebrew community. Realising that self-taught amateurs were
able to network with each other to create products without large amounts
of capital was hugely inspiring to me. While the culture of software
development has changed since then, I’m still amazed by what can be
built by small empowered teams.

As a full-stack engineer I’ve managed to stay on top of language trends,
however often work in JavaScript due to its prevalence, or Rust due to
its forward-thinking design. I consider my speciality to be in combining
technical knowledge with lateral thinking, and a role I like to occupy
is that of advising businesses on cross-functional product/technical
designs that should maximise their *technical leverage* while also
reducing their exposure to *execution costs*.

Over the years, my engineering practices have been influenced by: [the
twelve-factor app](http://12factor.net), functional programming,
micro-services, unit testing (TDD), the [Elm
Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/), and
[Simple Made Easy](http://infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).

**Technical specialties:** Full-stack software design and
implementation. I follow the mantra *the right tool for the right job*
and quickly pick things up. I enjoy working both on the back-end with
Node.JS and Rust; and on the front-end with JavaScript, React, Redux and
Flowtype. I’ve also done some work for iOS using Swift.

**Leadership, Product & Operations:** Experience in team leadership;
enjoy being involved in: product design, UX, customer/business
modelling/analysis; ran a Hackathon with 80 participants.

##### **[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/)** *London, United Kingdom*
###### **Software Engineer** *Sep '15 – Dec '15*

*The Economist is an English-language weekly newspaper.*

- Numerous components (e.g. [`@economist/component-articletemplate`](https://github.com/economist-components/component-articletemplate)) used in [The World In 2016 project](http://www.theworldin.com) and potentially other projects.

##### **[Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office)** *London, United Kingdom*
###### **Contract Technology Lead** *Jan '15 – Sep '15*

*The Home Office is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for immigration, security, and law and order.*

- Rebuilt a sprawling legacy system into 6 Node.js microservices harnessing infrastructure, services and libraries built for the Passport Exemplar project.
- 1 JWT Authentication API with LDAP as its backing service; 1 old-school Express.js front-end app; 1 single-page app built with React + Flux + ES6 (Babel); 2 RESTful Express.js APIs; and 1 command-line app to run tasks on the Postgres database.
- Gave strategic advice on the architecture of a new project, and later presented this plan at ’Show and Tell’ to a wide range of people throughout the organisation.
- Created some early prototypes using Java 8 + Dropwizard + Swagger.

##### **[Red Badger](https://red-badger.com/)** *London, United Kingdom*
###### **Contract Node.JS Consultant** *Mar '14 – Jul '14*

*Hailo is the evolution of the hail – a free smartphone app which puts people just two taps away from a licensed taxi, and lets cabbies get more passengers when they want them.*

- Created a series of single-page dashboard apps. Conversations with internal customers helped me to come up with ideas on how to simplify business processes. For example a way of signing off groups of driver’s profile changes was given a UX that defaulted to approval but forced the user to sign a receipt of the changes: this helps with speed while also ensuring accountability.
- Other components were created so that behaviour relating to presentation was well-separated from configuration and data input; or made so that they could be updated in real-time, for example: an animated map of driver locations.

##### **[BIZZBY](https://bizzby.com/)** *London, United Kingdom*
###### **Senior Node.JS Engineer** *Apr '13 – Jun '13*

- Designed and lead the creation of a back-end system to support a sport game as well as recruiting developers for my team.
- The system was decomposed into multiple services and stored data in Cassandra. I created a service which would automatically generate a series of questions from a stream of data and a template, a real-time market-outcome resolution service that would automatically resolve a series of previously generated questions depending on a simple DSL and a stream of real-life data, and a service that could have data pushed to or pulled from it and parse this data into a common format before feeding it into a message queue for deeper processing.
- Setup a continuous integration system using Jenkins, and used Puppet to automate deployment of some of the services to AWS. Later on third-party data issues were reported to stakeholders and dealt with through design chances relating to logging and testing the data quality.

##### **[Saffron Digital](http://saffrondigital.com/)** *London, United Kingdom*
###### **Team Lead** *Oct '10 – Oct '12*

*Saffron Digital is the global, market-leading provider of connected device video, DRM, advertising and platform services. Saffron Digital was acquired by HTC in 2011.*

Due to my early work on internationalisation and implementation of multiple payment services we were able to run this globally in close to 20 countries. Later on the project became a baseline for future web services for other clients.
- Significant input in re-engineering development process as we moved from being a startup to a larger company. For example: an engineer empowering company culture; Git instead of SVN; continuous integration; modern deployment tools; etc.
- Architecture and development of a new platform based on understandings gleaned from previous services. Worked on service to orchestrate and configure encoders in order to run encodes in parallel on AWS.
- A client-side application for Samsung Connected TVs and set-top boxes written in object-orientated JavaScript.
