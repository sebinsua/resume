\noindent \emph{Product-focused Technology Lead.}
\\
\\
I learnt to program when I was sixteen after discovering a small but flourishing homebrew community. Realising that self-taught amateurs were able to network with each other to create products without large amounts of capital was hugely inspiring to me. While the culture of software development has changed since then, I'm still amazed by what can be built by small empowered teams.\newline

As a full-stack engineer I've managed to stay on top of language trends, however often work in JavaScript due to its prevalence, or Rust due to its forward-thinking design. I consider my speciality to be in combining technical knowledge with lateral thinking, and a role I like to occupy is that of advising businesses on cross-functional product/technical designs that should maximize their \emph{technical leverage} while also reducing their exposure to \emph{execution costs}.

Over the years, my engineering practices have been influenced by: \href{http://12factor.net}{the twelve-factor app}, functional programming, micro-services, unit testing  (\acr{TDD}), the \href{https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/}{Elm Architecture}, and \href{http://infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy}{Simple Made Easy}.\newline

  {Technical specialties:}
  {Full-stack software design and implementation. I follow the mantra \emph{the right tool for the right job} and quickly pick things up. I enjoy working both on the back-end with Node.JS and Rust; and on the front-end with JavaScript, React, Redux and Flowtype. I've also done some work for iOS using Swift.}

      \item Created a series of single-page dashboard apps. Conversations with internal customers helped me to come up with ideas on how to simplify business processes. For example a way of signing off groups of driver's profile changes was given a UX that defaulted to approval but forced the user to sign a receipt of the changes: this helps with speed while also ensuring accountability.
      \item Other components were created so that behaviour relating to presentation was well-separated from configuration and data input; or made so that they could be updated in real-time, for example: an animated map of driver locations.

            \item The system was decomposed into multiple services and stored data in Cassandra. I created a service which would automatically generate a series of questions from a stream of data and a template, a real-time market-outcome resolution service that would automatically resolve a series of previously generated questions depending on a simple DSL and a stream of real-life data, and a service that could have data pushed to or pulled from it and parse this data into a common format before feeding it into a message queue for deeper processing.
            \item Setup a continuous integration system using Jenkins, and used Puppet to automate deployment of some of the services to AWS. Later on third-party data issues were reported to stakeholders and dealt with through design chances relating to logging and testing the data quality.
